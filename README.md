Task 6: House Price Prediction

Objective
To build a regression model that predicts house prices using property features such as income level, location, house age, and room distribution.

Dataset
California Housing Dataset (publicly available dataset)

 Steps Performed
- Dataset loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
